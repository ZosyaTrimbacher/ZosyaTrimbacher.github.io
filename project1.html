    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Estimate staffing needs during the U.S. influenza season and provide a clear, data-driven plan for allocating
      nurses, doctors, and PAs across states. I cleaned and merged CDC influenza deaths with U.S. Census demographics,
      analyzed seasonal and age-group patterns, and built a stakeholder-friendly Tableau storyboard.
      <br>Role: Data Analyst • Tools: Tableau, Excel • Timeline: ~2 weeks
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <h3>Research & Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Merged CDC influenza deaths with Census population by state; handled missing values and consistency checks.</li>
      <li>Explored mortality by age group and state; confirmed elderly risk (65+) with a one-tailed t-test.</li>
      <li>Checked correlation between elderly share and flu deaths to inform prioritization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation & Visualization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tiered states into low / medium / high staffing need using vulnerability indicators.</li>
      <li>Built spatial (state) and temporal (monthly) views to reveal where and when demand spikes.</li>
      <li>Packaged insights in a concise Tableau storyboard for non-technical stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Peak demand consistently falls in Dec–Feb (often highest in January); activity rises from October and drops after March.</li>
      <li>States with large senior populations show higher risk, guiding who should receive extra coverage first.</li>
      <li>Large states like CA, NY, and TX show sustained burden across seasons, informing baseline allocation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome & Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Clear seasonal windows and a state tiering framework to minimize under/over-staffing during surges.
      Limitation: deaths-only data underestimates total clinical load; next iteration would add hospitalizations or ILI visits.
