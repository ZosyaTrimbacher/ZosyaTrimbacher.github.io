    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a data-driven professional with 12+ years of experience in operations, project management, and executive support, including four years in the tech and fintech sectors at Delivery Hero. After working closely with global leadership to streamline internal processes and manage cross-functional projects, I decided to transition into data analytics to deepen my ability to solve problems and uncover insights.</p>
    <p>I’m currently looking for opportunities in the Data field as an Operational Analyst, Business Analyst, Project Coordinator or Operational Specialist.</p>
    I recently completed an intensive five-month full-time CareerFoundry Data Analytics program, where I developed strong skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel. Through a series of hands-on projects, I gained practical experience in analyzing customer segmentation and spending behaviors, forecasting staffing needs based on demographic and seasonal trends, building pricing prediction models using regression techniques, clustering data to identify market segments, and creating interactive dashboards to visualize trends and support data-driven decision-making.</p>

 <p>Key Skills:</p>

 <p>- Data Analysis & Visualization: SQL, Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib), Tableau, Excel</p>

 <p>- Forecasting, Predictive Modeling & Clustering</p>

 <p>- Dashboard Design & Business Intelligence Reporting</p>

 <p>- Process Optimization & Workflow Automation</p>

 <p>- Project & Stakeholder Management</p>

 <p>I’m passionate about turning data into insights that drive smarter decisions and improve operational performance. I’m currently seeking opportunities as an Operations Analyst, Operations Specialist, Business Analyst, or Data Analyst, where I can combine my analytical skills and operational experience to make a measurable business impact.</p>
