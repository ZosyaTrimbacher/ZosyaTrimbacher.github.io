    <p>I’m a data-driven professional with 12+ years of experience in operations, project management, and executive support, including four and a half years in the tech and fintech sectors at Delivery Hero. After working closely with global leadership to streamline internal processes and manage cross-functional projects, I decided to transition into data analytics to deepen my ability to solve problems and uncover insights.</p>
    I recently completed an intensive five-month full-time CareerFoundry Data Analytics program, where I developed strong skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel. Through a series of hands-on projects, I gained practical experience in analyzing customer segmentation and spending behaviors, forecasting staffing needs based on demographic and seasonal trends, building pricing prediction models using regression techniques, clustering data to identify market segments, and creating interactive dashboards to visualize trends and support data-driven decision-making.</p>

  <p>
    I love being outdoors, especially skiing in the mountains whenever I get the chance. 
    I also spend a lot of time with my dog, Neko, who makes sure I take breaks from the screen 
    and reminds me to enjoy the simple things. Those moments keep me grounded and inspired 
    in both life and work.
